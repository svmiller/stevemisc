\description{
These are data generated in \pkg{peacesciencer} for all French leader-years from 1874 to 2015. I'm going to use
these data for stress-testing the calculation of so-called "peace spells" for data that are decidedly imbalanced,
as these are.
}
\details{
Data are generated in the development version (scheduled release of v. 0.7) of \pkg{peacesciencer}. Conflict data
come from the GML MID data. Leader data come from Archigos.
