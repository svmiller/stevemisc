`{stevemisc}` is an R package that includes various functions and tools
that I have written over the years to assist me in my research,
teaching, and public presentations (i.e. stuff I put on my blog). I
offer it here for a public release because 1) I am vain and think I want
an entire, eponymous ecosystem in the R programming language (i.e. the
“steveverse”) and 2) I think there are tools here that are broadly
useful for users that I’m trying to bundle with other things that I
offer (prominently
[`{steveproj}`](https://github.com/svmiller/steveproj)). Namely,
`{stevemisc}` offers tools to assist in data organization, data
presentation, data recoding, and data simulation.

## Installation

You can install this on CRAN.

``` r
install.packages("stevemisc")
```

You can install the development version of `{stevemisc}` from Github via
the `{devtools}` package. I suppose using the `{remotes}` package would
work as well.

``` r
devtools::install_github("svmiller/stevemisc")
```
