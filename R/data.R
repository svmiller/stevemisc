#' German Dyad-Years, 1816-2020

#' in between years. In the Correlates of War context, Germany disappears from the international system from 1945 to 1990. It'll
#' also serve as a nice test for making sure spell calculations don't misbehave in the context of missing data. In this application,

#' United States Militarized Interstate Disputes (MIDs)
#'
#' This is a non-directed dyad-year data set for militarized interstate disputes involving
#' the United States. I created these to illustrate the \code{sbtscs()} function.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 14586 observations on the following 6 variables.

#' \item{\code{midonset}}{was there a new inter-state dispute onset in the dyad-year}
#' }
#'
#' @details
#'
#' Data were generated some time ago. Rare cases where there were multiple disputes ongoing
#' in a given dyad-year were first whittled by isolating 1) unique dispute onsets. Thereafter,
#' the data select the 2) highest fatality, then 3) the highest hostility level, and then 4)
#' the longer dispute, until 5) just picking whichever one came first. There are no duplicate non-directed dyad-year observations.

#' Map Quiz Wrong Guesses Across Five Intro to IR Courses
#'
#' This is a simple data set that records every wrong guess for map quiz

#'
#' @format A data frame with 1772 observations on the following 8 variables.
#' \describe{
#' \item{\code{class}}{an ordered factor of the semester in which the wrong

#' \item{\code{students}}{the number of students in the class taking the
#' map quiz.}
#' \item{\code{region}}{the region map on which the country was located.
#' Values include "Europe", "Africa", "Asia", "Latin America", and "MENA."
#' "MENA" is short for "Middle East and North Africa."}
#' \item{\code{country}}{the country I asked the student to correctly
#' identify}
#' \item{\code{guess}}{the country that was the actual state incorrectly
#' guessed by the student}
#' \item{\code{ccode1}}{the Correlates of War state code for

#' \code{country} and \code{guess}}}
#'
#' @details
#'
#' Students can always not make a guess and be wrong, which explains the
#' \code{NA}s in the data. Students were given five
#' separate numbered maps and prompted to identify 10 countries each on
#' them. The maps never changed across five semesters, nor did the prompts.
#' Use these data as you see fit. Obviously, FERPA considerations mean I
#' can't share anything else of potential value here.

#' Charitable Contributions Panel Data
#'
#' This is a toy panel data set on charitable contributions across 10 years for
#' 47 taxpayers. It's useful for illustrating the estimation of panel models.

#' Frees (2003) is the nominal source for these data, as they appear as toy data
#' sets for use in his book. He in turn cites Banerjee and Frees (1995), though
#' this citation may have been meant for a 1997 article in *Journal of the
#' American Statistical Association*. The
#' actual source for these data as I obtained them is Gujarati (2012). The
#' underlying source of the raw data are supposedly the 1979-1988
#' *Statistics of Income* Panel of Individual Tax Returns. Given the opacity of
#' the data, and its temporal limitations, these data should only be used for
#' illustration and not inference.
#'
#' The charitable contributions variable and income variables are very clearly
#' log-transformed. Banerjee and Price (1997) seem to imply the price variable
#' is as well.
