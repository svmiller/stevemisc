## Feedback Upon Initial Rejection

I forgot I enabled HTTPS on my website when I switched from an American to a European provider. I apologize for wasting your time. This should be fixed now.

## Test environment

- Pop! OS 22.04, R 4.1.2

## Initial Comments to CRAN

R CMD check done via `devtools::check()`, resulting in 0 errors, 0 warnings and 0 notes.

`devtools::spell_check()` results in a lot of typos, all of which are false positives.

## Downstream dependencies

`{peacesciencer}`, a package I created and maintain, is a downstream dependency. That package is unaffected by this release.
