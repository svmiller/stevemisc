\usage{
print_refs(
  bib,
  csl = "american-political-science-association.csl",
  toformat = "latex",
  cslrepo = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{bib}{a valid \code{.bib} entry}

\item{csl}{a CSL file, matching one available on the Github repository, that the user wants to format the references. Default is "american-political-science-association.csl".}

\item{toformat}{the output wanted by the user. Default is "latex".}

\item{cslrepo}{a directory of CSL files. Defaults to the one on Github.}
}
\value{
\code{print_refs()} takes a \code{.bib} entry and returns a formatted reference from it.
}
\description{
\code{print_refs()} is a convenience function I found and edited that will allow a user to print and format
\code{.bib} entries as if they were references. This function is useful if you want to load a \code{.bib} entry or set of
entries and print them in the middle of a document in R Markdown.
}
\details{
\code{print_refs()} assumes an active internet connection in the absence of the appropriate CSL file in the
working directory. The citation style language (CSL) file supplied by the user must match a file in the
massive Github repository of CSL files. Users interested in potential outputs should read more about Pandoc (\url{https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html}).
The Github repository of CSL files is available here: \url{https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles}.
