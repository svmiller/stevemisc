\title{Recode a Variable}
\usage{
carrec(var, recodes, as_fac, as_num = TRUE, levels)

carr(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{var}{numeric vector, character vector, or factor}

\item{recodes}{character string of recode specifications: see below, but
former Stata users will find this stuff familiar}

\item{as_fac}{return a factor; default is \code{TRUE} if \code{var} is a
factor,  \code{FALSE} otherwise}

\item{as_num}{if \code{TRUE} (which is the default) and \code{as.factor} is \code{FALSE},
the result will be coerced to a numeric if all values in the result are numeric.
This should be what you want in 99\% of applications for regression analysis.}

\item{levels}{an optional argument specifying the order of the levels in the
returned factor; the default is to use the sort order of the level names.}

\item{...}{optional, only to make the shortcut (\code{carr()}) work}
}
\value{
\code{carrec()} returns a vector, recoded to the specifications of the
user. \code{carr()} is a simple shortcut for\code{carrec()}.
}
\description{
This recodes a numeric vector, character vector, or factor
according to fairly simple recode specifications that former Stata users
will appreciate. Yes, this is taken from John Fox's \code{recode()} unction in
his \pkg{car} package. I'm going with \code{carrec()} (i.e. shorthand for
\code{car::recode()}, phonetically here: "car-wreck") for this package, with
an additional shorthand of \code{carr} that does the same thing.

The goal here is to minimize the number of function clashes with
multiple packages that I use in my workflow. For example: \pkg{car},
\pkg{dplyr}, and \pkg{Hmisc} all have \code{recode()} functions. I rely on
the \pkg{car} package just for this function, but it conflicts with some
other \pkg{tidyverse} functions that are vital to my workflow.

\details{
Recode specifications appear in a character string, separated by
semicolons (see the examples below), of the form input=output. If an input
value satisfies more than one specification, then the first (from left to
right) applies. If no specification is satisfied, then the input value is
carried over to the result. NA is allowed on input and output.

\examples{
x <- seq(1,10)
carrec(x,"0=0;1:2=1;3:5=2;6:10=3")
