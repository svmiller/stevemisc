\title{Scale a vector by one standard deviation}
\usage{
r1sd(x, na = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric vector}
}
\value{
The function returns a numeric vector rescaled with a mean of 0 and a
standard deviation of 1.
}
\description{
\code{r1sd} allows you to rescale a numeric vector such that the
ensuing output has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
}
\details{
This is a convenience function since the default `rescale()` function
has some additional weirdness that is not welcome for my use cases. By default,
`na.rm` is set to TRUE.
}
\examples{

x <- rnorm(100)
r1sd(x)
}
