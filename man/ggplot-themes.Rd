\title{Steve's Preferred \pkg{ggplot2} Themes and Assorted Stuff}
\usage{
theme_steve(...)

theme_steve_web(...)

post_bg(...)

theme_steve_ms(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{optional stuff, but don't put anything in here. You won't need it.}
}
\value{
\code{post_bg()} takes a \pkg{ggplot2} plot and changes the background to have a color of
"#fdfdfd". \code{theme_steve()} takes a \pkg{ggplot2} plot and formats it to approximate
\code{theme_bw()} from \pkg{ggplot2}, but with some other tweaks. \code{theme_steve_web()} extends
\code{theme_steve()} to add custom fonts, notably "Open Sans" and "Titillium Web". In all cases, these
functions take a \pkg{ggplot2} plot and return another \pkg{ggplot2} plot, but with some cosmetic
changes. \code{theme_steve_ms()} takes a \pkg{ggplot2} plot and overlays "Crimson Text" fonts, which is
the basis of the \code{cochineal} font package in \code{LaTeX}.
}
\description{
\code{theme_steve()} was a preferred theme of mine a few years ago. It is
basically \code{theme_bw()} from \pkg{ggplot2} theme, but with me
tweaking a few things. I've since moved to \code{theme_steve_web()} for most things
now, prominently on my website. It incorporates the "Open Sans" and "Titillium Web"
fonts that I like so much. \code{post_bg()} is for changing the backgrounds on
plots to better match my website for posts that I write. \code{theme_steve_ms()} is
for \code{LaTeX} manuscripts that use the \code{cochineal} font package.
}
\details{
\code{theme_steve_web()} depends on having the fonts installed on your end.
It's ultimately optional for you to have them.
