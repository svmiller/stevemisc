Description: These are miscellaneous scripts that I find useful for my research.
    This includes a better/faster "peace-year" function for binary time-series
    cross-section (BTSCS) research, my default ggplot theme that's flexible and
    aesthetically pleasing for LaTeX and the web, and a function for plotting
    levels of a random effect from a mixed effects model.
