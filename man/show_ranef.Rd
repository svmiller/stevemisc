\title{Get a caterpillor plot of random effects from a mixed model}
\usage{
show_ranef(data, grp, reorder = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a fitted mixed model with random intercepts}

\item{grp}{What random intercept/slopes do you want to see as a caterpillar plot? Declare it as a character}

\item{reorder}{optional argument. DEFAULT is TRUE, which ``re-orders'' the intercepts by the
original value in the data. If FALSE, the ensuing caterpillar plot defaults to a default method of ordering
the levels of the random effect by their estimated conditional mode.}
}
\value{
\code{show_ranef()} returns a caterpillar plot of the random intercepts from a given
mixed model. If \code{broom.mixed::augment()} can process it, this function should work just fine.
}
\description{
\code{show_ranef()} allows a user estimating a mixed model to quickly
plot the random intercepts (with conditional variances) of a given random effect
in a mixed model. In cases where there is a random slope over the intercept, the function
plots the random slope as another caterpillar plot (as another facet)
}
\details{
This function is a simple wrapper in which \code{broom.mixed} and, obviously
\code{ggplot2} are doing the heavy lifting.
